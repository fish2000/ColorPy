    Create all the sample figures.

figures_clip_clamp_to_zero () -
    Adjust the color clipping method, and create the sample figures.

figures_gamma_245 () -
    Adjust the gamma correction to a power law gamma = 2.45 and create samples.
    
figures_white_A () -
    Adjust the white point (for Luv/Lab) and create sample figures.
