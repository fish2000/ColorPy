thinfilm.py - Thin film interference colors.

Description:

Reflection from a thin film, as a function of wavelength, thickness, and index of refraction of materials.

Note that film thicknesses are given in nm instead of m, as this is a more convenient unit in this case.

We consider incident light from a medium of index of refraction n1,
striking a thin film of index n2, with a third medium of index n3 behind the film.

The total reflection from the film, back towards the incident light, is calculated.

Some sample values of the index of refraction:
    air :          n = 1.003
    water:         n = 1.33
    glass/plastic: n = 1.5
    oil:           n = 1.44 (matches Minnaert's color observations)

Functions:

class thin_film (n1, n2, n3, thickness_nm) -
    Represents a thin film, with the indices of refraction n1,n2,n3 representing:
	n1 - index of refraction of infinite region the light comes from
	n2 - index of refraction of finite region of the film
	n3 - index of refraction of infinite region beyond the film
    and thickness_nm being the thickness of the film [nm].

On these class objects, the following functions are available:

get_interference_reflection_coefficient (wl_nm) - 
    Get the reflection coefficient for the intensity for light
    of the given wavelength impinging on the film.

reflection_spectrum () - 
    Get the reflection spectrum (independent of illuminant) for the thin film.

illuminated_spectrum (illuminant) - 
    Get the spectrum when illuminated by the specified illuminant.
    
illuminated_color (illuminant) - 
    Get the xyz color when illuminated by the specified illuminant.

Plots:

thinfilm_patch_plot (n1, n2, n3, thickness_nm_list, illuminant, title, filename) -
    Make a patch plot of the color of the film for each thickness [nm].

thinfilm_color_vs_thickness_plot (n1, n2, n3, thickness_nm_list, illuminant, title, filename) -
    Plot the color of the thin film for the specfied thicknesses [nm].

thinfilm_spectrum_plot (n1, n2, n3, thickness_nm, illuminant, title, filename) -
    Plot the spectrum of the reflection from a thin film for the given thickness [nm].
