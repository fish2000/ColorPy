ColorPy is a Python package to convert physical descriptions of light:
    spectra of light intensity vs. wavelength - into RGB colors that can
    be drawn on a computer screen.
    It provides a nice set of attractive plots that you can make of such
    spectra, and some other color related functions as well.
